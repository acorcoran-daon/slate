## Permission Metadata
When getting a resource via the API, it is possible to return the other allowed permissions for the calling user on that resource. This is primarily to be used as an aid to application developers in determining whether certain buttons on a user interface should be enabled. For example, if the user has permission to list <code>Policies</code> but is not allowed to add a new <code>Policy</code> then the create <code>Policy</code> button could be disabled, rather than allowing a user to create it and then get a permissions error on submission. To include this information in any GET request, a query parameter called includeAuthorizationInfo should be set to true in the request. This will result in an attribute called allowedPermissions being returned which is a comma delimited list of permissions the user has on that specific resource.
