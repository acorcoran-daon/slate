# Overview

## Introduction

The API is a REST-based API for communicating with the IdentityX OnBoarding Server. It has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate errors. For error conditions, more specific IdentityX error codes are also included to give more information about the error. 

All responses from the API are in JSON format. 

These REST services are secured by digest authentication to guarantee authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation of the messages transferred. 

Daon supplies Java and JavaScript SDKs which wrap the digest generation and the specifics of calling the REST services and present a language-specific interface for relying party developers to use in developing their applications. 

The REST API is provided for relying parties to interact with the IdentityX OnBoarding Server functionality. It supports operations which are required to complete an OnBoarding process. 


## Base URL

In IdentityX, the URL specifies the tenant that the request relates to, or the system if the request is at a system level. This tenant is indicated by a sub-domain on the URL of the system. Examples:

* <url>https://tenant1.domain.com/IdentityXOnBoardingServices/rest/v1</url>
would be the base URL for a tenant with a domain identifier of tenant1.

* <url>https://tenant2.domain.com/IdentityXOnBoardingServices/rest/v1</url>
would be the base URL for a tenant with a domain identifier of tenant2.

The following sample base URL is used in the sections below:

* <url>https://tenant.domain.com/IdentityXOnBoardingServices/rest/v1</url>

All entities in IdentityX have ID and href attributes. Generally the href attribute is used in IdentityX to identify the entities. This href attribute is the base URL plus the entity type, such as users, idchecks or documents, and the unique identifier of the entity (the ID). For example, an href attribute for an ID Check might be:

* <url>https://tenant.domain.com/IdentityXOnBoardingServices/rest/v1/users/QTAzN9Yht3IL-Q714vX0tJyMgQ/idchecks/</url>


## Authentication

Requests to the IdentityX REST API are required to be signed. This signing is used to provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. The messages are signed by attaching a HMAC to each request. This HMAC is generated by a token which has been issued to the client by the server. The HMAC is calculated over the body of the request as well as HTTP headers and also includes a nonce and timestamp to prevent replay attacks. Daon supplies SDKs in Java and Javascript which do this signing process. The IdentityX services add a HMAC to the REST responses as well and the client can verify that this matches the HMAC calculated on the response with the client’s shared secret. The signing process is also detailed in the following document if a developer wants to develop their own solution:

IdentityX 4.0 QRG – Authenticating to REST Services

**NOTE: All API requests must be made over HTTPS.**

## Search

You can search for a specific resource or resources within a resource collection by using certain query parameters to specify search criteria. Searching is case insensitive and supports an asterisk (*) as a wildcard. Searches are treated as exact (case insensitive) matches if the wildcard is not used. The searchable query parameter(s) are documented on a per operation basis.

Some searches can also be filtered by status using the optional status query parameter. By default resources with any status are returned. If this parameter is included though, then the resources returned can be limited to a particular status such as ACTIVE or ARCHIVED (see individual operations for allowable values).

**Example Request:** Searching for ID Checks with a <code>referenceId</code> beginning with ‘Thales’ and a <code>status</code> of ACTIVE:

<url><code>GET</code> https://tenant.domain.com/DigitalOnBoardingServices/rest/v1/idchecks/?referenceId=Thales&status=ACTIVE</url>

## Versioning

The current version of the IdentityX REST API is v1. This version number will be changed for subsequent releases. But the previous versions will still be supported by the server until deprecated at a suitable time. The major version of the API is part of the href attribute used to access resources. The following two URLs refer to the same user, however the first will return the version 1 representation of the user and the second will return their version 2 representation of the user (which may have additional properties or other changes):

<url>https://tenant.domain.com/DigitalOnBoardingServices/rest/v1/users/QTAzN9Yht3IL-Q714vX0tJyMgQ/idchecks<url>

<url>https://tenant.domain.com/DigitalOnBoardingServices/rest/v2/users/QTAzN9Yht3IL-Q714vX0tJyMgQ/idchecks<url>

<aside class="notice">
<b>NOTE:</b> It is strongly recommended that if external systems are storing the identifiers of IdentityX entities, the id of the entity should be stored rather than the href attribute as this href attribute may change over time as the system location and version of IdentityX may change.
</aside>

## Resources and Pagination

All top-level IdentityX API resources have support for “list” API methods which return multiple resources in one call. For example, ‘all idChecks with a referenceId starting with thales’. These API methods return a Collection Resource, which is a resource containing an array of other resources such as IdChecks or Policies. A request may return a large number of resources, so pagination is used to break up the results into one or more pages.

The metadata attribute of a Collection Resource contains information such as the total count of resources in the collection, the current page and limit per page. The paging attribute has links to the first, previous, next and last pages in the collection. These links will be null if they represent the current page, such that if the current page is the first page then the first and previous links will be null (much as the first and previous buttons on a UI would be disabled in this case). Likewise, the next and last links will point to the appropriate pages assuming there are multiple pages in the collection.

### Collection Resource

Attribute  |  Description  |  Type
---------  |  -----------  |  ----
href | The fully qualified location URI of the Collection Resource   |  String
metadata  |  Collection metadata  |  Object
page  |  The page number in the collection these resources represent. | Integer
limit | The maximum number of resources to return in one request. | Integer
totalCount | The total number of resources in the collection. | Integer
paging | Links to first, previous, next and last pages in the collection. | Object
first | The location of the first page in the collection. This will be null if there is only one page, or if the current page is also the first page. | String
previous | The location of the previous page in the collection. This will be null if there is only one page, or if the current page is also the first page. | String
next | The location of the next page in the collection. This will be null if there is only one page, or if the current page is also the last page. | String
last | The location of the last page in the collection. This will be null if there is only one page, or if the current page is also the last page. | String
items | An array containing the current page of resources. | Array


**Example Response**: Listing all idchecks:

The metadata section shows this is the first page of twenty, with 485 users in total. This is the first page in the collection so the first and previous links are null; the next and last links show URIs for the respective next and last pages.

```json
{
}
```

## Sorting

A request for a collection resource can contain optional sortField and sortAscending parameters:

* sortField – the name of the property the returned resources should be sorted by. Allowable values are specified on a per operation basis in the documentation.
* sortAscending – true or false

Every request returning a collection has a default sort field and direction. The default direction depends on the default sort field. Generally sortAscending defaults to true when the default sortField is a text property, but if the default sortField is a date then sortAscending is defaulted to false to show the most recent entries at the top.

**Example Request:** Returning users sorted by most recent creation date:

<url><code>GET</code> https://tenant.domain.com/IdentityXServices/rest/v1/users?sortField=created&sortAscending=false</url>

## Links

Many IdentityX resources are related to other resources and contain links to them in their response properties. A link property is a nested object that contains an href attribute which is the fully qualified location URI of the linked resource. For example, a <code>IDCheck</code> has an associated <code>User</code>, <code>Documents</code>, <code>Faces</code> etc., and the JSON representation of a registration would contain two link properties such as in the example below:

```json
{

}
```
                        
The user link above is referred to as Instance links, as they refer to a specific instance of another resource. The other type of link is a Collection link which is the location of a related collection of resources, for example, the IDCheck request related to a specific user. In this scenario, the user representation below would have an authenticationRequests link attribute:

```json
{
  
}
```
                        
Many of these links can be expanded inline via a request parameter - see Expanding Resources below.


## Expanding Resources
When retrieving a resource with the IdentityX API, you can request that the server return not only that resource but also one or more of its related (linked) resources. 

Expanded resources are not yet implemented by the OnBoarding REST API.

## Sensitive Data
Biometric data and PII data is regarded as sensitive data and a special permission is required to be able to view a face photo or request personally identifiable data such as the OCR'd data of an identity docuemnt. When requesting a resource which has sensitive data, this data will not be returned by default (although associated metadata will be). To retrieve the actual sensitive data itself, a query parameter called sensitiveData must be included and set to true and the caller must have the requisite permission.

Retrieving a IDCheck's face data without requesting the sensitive data would return JSON such as the segment below. The metadata is returned and an href attribute linking to the location of the raw data is included. If the sensitiveData query parameter is set to true, then a value attribute would also be returned containing the base64-encoded face.

```json
{
  
}
```

## Permission Metadata
When getting a resource via the API, it is possible to return the other allowed permissions for the calling user on that resource. This is primarily to be used as an aid to application developers in determining whether certain buttons on a user interface should be enabled. For example, if the user has permission to list <code>Policies</code> but is not allowed to add a new <code>Policy</code> then the create <code>Policy</code> button could be disabled, rather than allowing a user to create it and then get a permissions error on submission. To include this information in any GET request, a query parameter called includeAuthorizationInfo should be set to true in the request. This will result in an attribute called allowedPermissions being returned which is a comma delimited list of permissions the user has on that specific resource.

## Errors

Responses from the REST API use conventional HTTP response status codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. A 200 (or 201 in the case of a new resource being created) is returned on success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error with authorization or the information supplied with the request. A 500 code indicates an error with IdentityX’s servers.

HTTP Status code | Description
---------------- | -----------
200 - OK | Success, everything worked as expected
201 - Created | Success, new resource created
400 - Bad Request | The request was invalid, often missing a required parameter. More details in the response body
401 - Unauthorized | Authentication credentials were missing or incorrect, or the caller does not have sufficient permission.
404 - Not Found | The requested item does not exist, or the URI requested is invalid.
405 - Method Not Allowed | A request was made of a resource using a request method not supported by that resource.
500 - Server Error | There was an error within the IdentityX Server.

If an error occurs, the response body will contain an Error object containing the following information:

Attribute | Description | Type
--------- | ----------- | ----
httpStatus | The HTTP response status code | Integer
message | A simple user-friendly message that could optionally be displayed directly to application end user (but not language-aware) | String
developerMessage | A verbose, plain language description of the problem for the app developer with hints about how to fix it | String
code | An IdentityX-specific error code | Integer

# IDCheck operations

An IDCheck is created in order to establish Identity (ID). The IDCheck resouce represents all of the all of the data collected as part of the process of establishing Identity. It also contains all data generated when performing an evaluation of an the Identity (ID). <br><br> There is a one to many relationship between user and IDCheck. Multiple IDChecks may be created for various reason e.g. application for multiple financial products such as a bank account and in the future application for credit. <br><br> Multiple operations can be performed on an IDCheck - create, list, get, archive.
