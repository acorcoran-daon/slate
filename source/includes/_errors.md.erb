Responses from the REST API use conventional HTTP response status codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. A 200 (or 201 in the case of a new resource being created) is returned on success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error with authorization or the information supplied with the request. A 500 code indicates an error with IdentityX’s servers.

HTTP Status code | Description
---------------- | -----------
200 - OK | Success, everything worked as expected
201 - Created | Success, new resource created
400 - Bad Request | The request was invalid, often missing a required parameter. More details in the response body
401 - Unauthorized | Authentication credentials were missing or incorrect, or the caller does not have sufficient permission.
404 - Not Found | The requested item does not exist, or the URI requested is invalid.
405 - Method Not Allowed | A request was made of a resource using a request method not supported by that resource.
500 - Server Error | There was an error within the IdentityX Server.

If an error occurs, the response body will contain an Error object containing the following information:

Attribute | Description | Type
--------- | ----------- | ----
httpStatus | The HTTP response status code | Integer
message | A simple user-friendly message that could optionally be displayed directly to application end user (but not language-aware) | String
developerMessage | A verbose, plain language description of the problem for the app developer with hints about how to fix it | String
code | An IdentityX-specific error code | Integer
