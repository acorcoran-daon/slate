## Authentication

Requests to the IdentityX REST API are required to be signed. This signing is used to provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. The messages are signed by attaching a HMAC to each request. This HMAC is generated by a token which has been issued to the client by the server. The HMAC is calculated over the body of the request as well as HTTP headers and also includes a nonce and timestamp to prevent replay attacks. Daon supplies SDKs in Java and Javascript which do this signing process. The IdentityX services add a HMAC to the REST responses as well and the client can verify that this matches the HMAC calculated on the response with the client�s shared secret. The signing process is also detailed in the following document if a developer wants to develop their own solution:
