## Introduction

The API is a REST-based API for communicating with the IdentityX OnBoarding Server. It has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate errors. For error conditions, more specific IdentityX error codes are also included to give more information about the error. 

All responses from the API are in JSON format. 

These REST services are secured by digest authentication to guarantee authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation of the messages transferred. 

Daon supplies Java and JavaScript SDKs which wrap the digest generation and the specifics of calling the REST services and present a language-specific interface for relying party developers to use in developing their applications. 

The REST API is provided for relying parties to interact with the IdentityX OnBoarding Server functionality. It supports operations which are required to complete an OnBoarding process.
